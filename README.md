#Bio-signal-research-log

##**ðŸ“ŒPurpose**
This repository serves as my daily/weekly development log in the areas of *EEG signal processing* and *time-series modeling* .  
It is both a *personal research notebook* and a *public record* to share progress with the community and future collaborators.


##**âœ¨About Me**
ðŸŽ“Undergraduate researcher, majoring in *Artificial Intelligence* at Xiamen University Malaysia(2024 intake).  
ðŸ”¬Research interests: algorithms for healthcare, biosignal processing, EEG modeling ,Realtime decoding, wearable healthcare devices.


##**ðŸ“…Progress Timeline**

###up to Sep. 12, 2025
- Serving as an *undergraduate researcher* in an academic group:
- *One IEEE TIM submission (under review)*:  
  *[SleepDIFFormer: Sleep Stage Classification via Multivariate Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15215)*  
  - Contributed to the **Methods writing**,  
  - Designed the **overall model architecture figure**,  
  - Created **algorithm workflow illustrations** and **visualizations of results**.
    
- *Ongoing academic review* in the field of EEG processing.
  
- **Another manuscript targeting JCSM (Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine)**:  
  - Topic: Regression-tree-assisted diagnosis of sleep apnea.  
  - Contributed to the *Related Work* and *Discussion* sections.
    
- *Conducting Malaysiaâ€™s first national undergraduate BCI competition (DPickleball-BCI)*:  
  - Serving as a *core member of the Technical Committee*.  
  - Responsibilities include:
