# Bio-signal research log

## **ðŸ“ŒPurpose**
This repository serves as my weekly/monthly development log in the areas of *EEG signal processing* and *time-series modeling* .  
It is both a *personal research notebook* and a *public record* to share progress with the community and future collaborators.


## **âœ¨About Me**
ðŸŽ“Undergraduate researcher, majoring in *Artificial Intelligence* at Xiamen University Malaysia(2024 intake).  
ðŸ”¬Research interests: algorithms for healthcare, biosignal processing, EEG modeling ,Realtime decoding, wearable healthcare devices.


##**ðŸ“…Progress Timeline**

### up to Oct. 10, 2025
-Meet some tough problem with no improvements in EEGChallenge models, i need to reconsider the fine tuning method and think deeper about the basic principle of EEG modeling.
 It's okay to have no improvements, anyway it is a chance to find the breakthough point.
 
 Yah up to 11, i decided to rethink everything from data to models with my group, it's not too late to do so, mainwhile it's a milestone.
 
### up to Oct. 7, 2025
-during *IEEE SMC Hackthon*, i compelte the tasks including data preprocessing and modeling,designed a *CNN-based Dual-Branch structur*e to analyse SSVEP data, draw charts to show the results.Rerpo:
 https://github.com/mudcontract/ieee2025hackathon_g18team, also be the *presenter* during the "project presentation and Q&A" session.

### up to Oct. 5, 2025
-*2025 EEG Foundation Challenge*:
 fine-tuned some foudation model to check the performance: CBraMod,EEGMamba...to be add on later
 
-*IEEE SMC Hackthon*: (https://github.com/unicorn-bi/Hackathon.git).
 work in a team processing SSVEP eeg data.
 
### up to Sep. 12, 2025
- Serving as an *undergraduate researcher* in an academic group:
- *One IEEE TIM submission (under review)*:  
  *[SleepDIFFormer: Sleep Stage Classification via Multivariate Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15215)*  
  - Contributed to the **Methods writing**,  
  - Designed the **overall model architecture figure**,  
  - Created **algorithm workflow illustrations** and **visualizations of results**.
    
- *Ongoing academic review* in the field of EEG processing.
  
- **Another manuscript targeting JCSM (Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine)**:  
  - Topic: Regression-tree-assisted diagnosis of sleep apnea.  
  - Contributed to the *Related Work* and *Discussion* sections.
    
- *Conducting Malaysiaâ€™s first national undergraduate BCI competition (DPickleball-BCI)*:  
  - Serving as a *core member of the Technical Committee*.  
  - Responsibilities include:  
    - Assembling and debugging the *OpenBCI EEG acquisition kit*,  
    - Deploying *EEG signal processing algorithms*,  
    - Implementing basic paradigms such as Attention estimation, SSVEP and so on.


## ðŸ‘‰**Next steps**
- Participate in *The 2025 EEG Foundation Challenge: From Cross-Task to Cross-Subject EEG Decoding is a biosignal challenge accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track*
- Find new research topic for next semester
